## Monte Carlo Simulation of CCS Ambition

In 2019, **International Energy Agency** (IEA) released a scenario in its World Energy Outlook, called the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), to highlight that Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) contribute to 9% reduction of global CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 2050. This reduction is meant to reach 2015 Paris Agreement. IEA stated that to reach the 9% contribution, by 2050, **the mass of CO2 captured and permanently stored (captured CO<sub>2</sub> capacity) must reach 2.8 billion tonnes per annum**. In other words, a world institute for CCS, the **Global CCS Institute** further stated that to achieve the level outlined in the SDS, **number of CCUS facilities needs to increase a hundredfold by 2040**.

Do we really have to add new CCS fields a hundredfold by 2050 to reach this target? A simulation using Monte Carlo will answer this.
